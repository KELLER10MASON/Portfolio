1. Development Stack
Languages and Frameworks:

    C#: The primary language for the application.

    .NET (Core or Framework):

        .NET Core (Cross-platform) or .NET Framework (Windows-only).

        Use .NET 5 or later for new projects (preferably .NET 6 or higher).

        If you're targeting just Windows, the Windows Forms (WinForms) or WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) are ideal for creating native UIs.

Tools:

    Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code (with C# extension):

        Visual Studio is the full-featured IDE, while Visual Studio Code is lighter and more customizable.

        Visual Studio is recommended for WinForms and WPF apps due to its built-in tools for those frameworks.

Database or Storage (Optional):

    SQLite: If your application needs to store game data locally (e.g., player stats, game progress), SQLite is a lightweight database that works well in C# apps.

    JSON: For lightweight storage or configuration files (e.g., settings for the game hub).

UI Libraries:

    WinForms: Simple, classic GUI framework for Windows apps.

    WPF: More modern UI framework, supports MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) and richer UIs.

    UWP: Universal Windows Platform (if targeting Windows 10 or later).
